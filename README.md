# Bike Store Data Analysis

The goal of this project is to extract practical insights from the [Kaggle Bike Store dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dillonmyrick/bike-store-sample-database/data) using SQL Server. 

I focus on realistic business questions and translate stakeholder requests into clear, production-ready queries. The work highlights how SQL can be utilized in real-world scenarios - ranking top customers and stores, tracking growth month over month, mapping revenue by city/state for ad planning, and tying employee performance to managers for team visibility. 

Each Task can be found in a separate folder, which includes detailed task description, solution in SQL and results. Below you can find a short representation of each task.

- Task 1: Top customers: Identify the five highest-spending customers with their emails and order counts to target retention and outreach.
- Task 2: Store performance: Rank stores by lifetime revenue and flag the top seller each month to track leaders over time.
- Task 3: Growth view: Break down revenue, orders, and average items per order by year and month to read the trajectory.
- Task 4: Geo revenue: List all customer cities/states ranked by total revenue to guide ad placement and local campaigns.
- Task 5: Team + manager: Show every employee’s sales volume alongside their manager to understand team performance.
- Task 6: Repeat buyers: Identify customers with more than two orders and summarize spend, first purchase date, and latest purchase date to support lifecycle tactics.
